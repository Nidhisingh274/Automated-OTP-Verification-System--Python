# 🔐 **Automated OTP Verification System** 🚀

An automated **OTP verification system** built using Python. This project securely handles **user authentication** by sending a one-time password (OTP) to the user’s **email** and validating it within three attempts. It ensures **maximum security** with **automatic OTP generation**, **delivery**, and **validation**.

---

## 🌟 **Key Features** 🔥

- **🔑 OTP Generation:** Automatically generates a **secure, random 6-digit OTP** to ensure **randomization and unpredictability**.
- **📧 Email Integration:** OTP is **automatically sent** to the user's email using **Gmail SMTP**.
- **⚡ Verification Process:** Users get **three attempts** to enter the OTP, with **automated input validation** for **enhanced security**.

## 💡 **How It Works** 🤖

1. **🔑 User Input:** The user **enters** their **email address** to start the OTP process.
2. **🔒 OTP Generation:** A **random 6-digit OTP** is generated using Python’s `random.choices()` function for **secure** and **unique** codes.
3. **📤 OTP Delivery:** The OTP is **automatically sent** to the user's email via **Gmail's SMTP server**, no manual intervention required.
4. **📝 OTP Verification:** User enters the OTP received, and the system automatically validates it within **3 attempts**.
5. **✔️ Result:**
   - **✅ Success:** If OTP matches, the user is successfully authenticated.
   - **❌ Failure:** After 3 failed attempts, the system locks and asks the user to try again later.

## ⚙️ **Automation Workflow** 🔧

- **🔐 OTP Generation:** The OTP is fully automated using Python’s `random.choices()`, ensuring secure and random code generation for each session. 
- **📤 Email Delivery:** OTP is automatically sent via the **smtplib** library and **Gmail SMTP**, no manual input needed.
- **🔄 Verification:** The entire **validation process** (user input and multiple attempts) is automated for **maximum efficiency** and **security**.
