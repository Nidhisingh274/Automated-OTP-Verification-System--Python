DESCRIPTION
This project is a Python-based OTP (One-Time Password) verification system that enhances security by verifying users identities via email. The system generates a 6-digit OTP and sends it to the user's email address. The user must then input the received OTP to verify their identity within a limited number of attempts.

HOW IT WORKS
User Input: The user is prompted to enter their email address.
OTP Generation: A random 6-digit OTP is generated by the system.
OTP Delivery: The OTP is sent to the user's email address.
Verification: The user is prompted to enter the OTP received via email. The system allows three attempts for the user to enter the correct OTP.
Result: If the OTP matches, the user is successfully verified. If not, after three failed attempts, the system prompts the user to try again later.
